# OOP-Team-Profile-Generator


## Description

<p>This project was created to create an application for Team member generator. It contains notes on HTML, CSS and Nodejs.</p>
<p>I create a Team member generator application with using the Inquirer package that meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>This app runs in the terminal and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by node.js code.</p>
<p>I learned how to export and import module, write a new file with fs module and make a class to extend to others.</p>
<p>Also I learned write test.js to test the classes before coding so that I can write code easier</p><br>


## Installation

N/A<br><br>


## Usage
<p>To understand the code that I code, please read the comments in js files.</p>
<p>When User starts the application, the user will be prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.</p>
<p>When User enters the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, the user will be presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.</p>
<p>When User selects the engineer option, the user will be prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.</p>
<p>When User selects the intern option, the user will be prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.</p><br>
